# 🏦 Bank Customer Churn Prediction 
______________________________________

##  Project Overview

    Customer churn is one of the most critical problems in the banking sector.
    This project focuses on predicting whether a bank customer
    will leave the bank (churn) or not, using advanced Machine Learning techniques.
    and detailed exploratory data analysis.
    
    The goal is to identify churn-prone customers early, 
    so that banks can take preventive actions and improve customer retention.
    
##  Dataset Description

    Dataset Name: Churn Modelling Dataset

    Total Records: 10,000

    Total Features: 14 (before feature engineering)

    Target Variable: Exited

##  Target Variable

    Exited = 1 → Customer left the bank (Churned)
 
    Exited = 0 → Customer stayed with the bank
    
##  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key insights discovered from EDA:

🔹 80% customers stay, 20% customers churn → Imbalanced dataset

🔹 60% customers are aged between 30–45

🔹 Customers with lower tenure & fewer products are more likely to churn

🔹 Germany-based customers show higher churn tendency

🔹 Older customers are more likely to exit

🔹 Customers with low engagement (inactive members) have higher churn risk

## ⚙️ Feature Engineering
![Heatmap Correlation Matrix](Assests/HeatMap_Corelation_Matrix.jpeg)


- To improve predictive performance,
- multiple engineered features were created:

> Log & Sqrt Transformations
 
       Log_Balance
       Log_Age
       Sqrt_EstimatedSalary
       
> Interaction Features

    Balance_per_Product
    Age_Balance
    CreditScore_IsActive
    Tenure_NumOfProducts
    Age_Gender
    Non_France

These features helped capture hidden relationships in customer behavior.

##  Handling Imbalanced Data

> The dataset was highly imbalanced.
> To solve this:

        ADASYN (Adaptive Synthetic Sampling) was applied
        Generated synthetic samples for churned customers
        Resulted in balanced training data and improved recall.
        
##  Models Trained

> Multiple ML models were trained and compared:

| Model                     | Accuracy |
|---------------------------|----------|
| **CatBoost (Final Model)** | **90.4%** |
| Logistic Regression        | 81.4% |
| Random Forest              | 87.4% |
| XGBoost                    | 89.6% |

**Final Model: CatBoost Classifier**

       CatBoost performed best due to 
       its ability to handle complex 
       feature interactions.

## Evaluation Metrics

| Metric        | Value |
|--------------|-------|
| **Model**     | CatBoost |
| Accuracy     | 0.9041 |
| Precision    | 0.9201 |
| Recall       | 0.8749 |
| F1-score     | 0.8970 |
| ROC AUC      | **0.96** |
| Kappa Score  | 0.808 |

     ✔ High precision → fewer false churn alarms
     ✔ Strong recall → churn customers correctly identified
     ✔ Excellent ROC-AUC → robust classification capability
